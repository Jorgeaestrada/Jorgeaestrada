### 👋 Hi there, I'm Jorge Estrada

🌱 I'm a computer systems engineer specializing in **Artificial Intelligence**,

🌏 I'm very optimistic, determined, and analytical, I love the challenges and chaos keeps me awake.

:flying_saucer: My biggest goal is to travel the world and see places i have never seen.
